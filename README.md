uReport is a small scale, standalone, CRM web application with an Open311
(GeoReport v2) endpoint that should meet the needs of smaller municipalities
wishing to deploy Open311 and/or a lightweight constituent management tool.
Context-switched feeds (XML, JSON, etc) allow it to easily be integrated into
existing environments.
