			<h3><a name="actions">Actions</a></h3>
			
	<p>Actions are the steps a staff member takes to follow up on the request(s) on each case.</p>
	
	<h4>Doing Actions to Cases</h4>
	<p>Actions contain the date the action was performed, the title of the action itself, and a comment section for the details. The person who enters the action into the system is listed as the person who performed the action.</p>
	<p>You can add actions while viewing a case. To add an action, view the case, then choose the action you want to add from the list.</p>
	<p>If you do not see available actions, check the case's status. If a case is closed, no actions are allowed. You can reopen a case to perform more actions on it.</p>
	
	<h4>Available Actions</h4>
	<p>The actions available to you are based on your department. The list of actions available to a department is set up by a system administrator. To change the list of actions available to your department, contact ITS.</p>
	<p><a href="actions.html">Read more about actions</a></p>
			<h3><a name="history">History</a></h3>
			<p>A case's history is the list of Actions taken on the case. Each issue in a case also has a history of its own.<p>
	<p>A case's history contains the date the action took place, who performed the action, and the details in the form of a comment.</p>
	<p>You cannot edit the history of a case.</p>
	<p>An issue's history contains any Responses made to the constituent that reported the issue. It includes how the person was contacted, by whom, and when, as well as any comment from the staff member.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="status">Status</a></h3>
			<p>Staff members are able to change the status of a case. uReport contains two default statuses: open and closed. In addition, each department can define their own list of statuses to use.</p>
	
	<h4>Define your Department's List of Statuses</h4>
	<p>To create new statuses for your department, go to "My Department" and enter the name of each status you'd like to add, separated by commas.</p>
