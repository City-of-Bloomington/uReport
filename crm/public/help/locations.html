				<h1>Locations</h1>
				<p>Much of the time the matter being reported about will be based around a particular place. We are only allowing for locations that are found in GIS's list of master streets and addresses. This allows us to do two things:</p>
				
				<ol>
				<li>Make sure we have the most up-to-date information about that location (its neighborhood, changes to the address, property owner, etc).</li>
				<li>Keep a list of everything that has occurred at that location.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You can search and select either:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>A specific address</li>
				<li>A verified street in our master street database - for issues expanding past one specific location</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Subunits: The search results will not list subunits unless you ask for a specific subunit. If your intended address is a subunit, include the subunit in the address search box. If a matching subunit is found for that address, it will be included in the search results.</p>
				<h2>Searching for a location</h2>
				<p>Since many cases that have been migrated into uReport were not entered using a valid address, users are able to search for locations using any sort of text under the "Descriptive Location" search.</p>
				<p>If you know the location you're searching for contains a specific word, you can search for it here: such as roundabout or alley</p>
