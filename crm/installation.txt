Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------
framework:
This scaffolding requires our framework to be on the server somewhere.
It ships with a working version of framework installed in /libraries.
In the configuration, you can point the application to another copy
of the framework, if you like.  If you make changes to the code in
the /libraries/framework, you might consider sending those changes
back to us, so we can improve this scaffolding.

ZendFramework:
Database interaction for this application is done using Zend_Db.  You must
have downloaded a copy of the ZendFramework for this to work.  In the
configuration, you will point the application to wherever you've installed
your copy of the ZendFramework.  The ZendFramework is available under a
BSD license at:
http://framework.zend.com/

Apache:
This application was written assuming you have control over your own web
server.  If you are on a hosted system, you may need to make changes to
the code to accomodate your server.

All webserver instructions assume the Apache webserver.  It is certainly
possible to set this using a different web server. However, we don't have
any experience with other webservers and cannot provide information on
their configuration.

All include files have been kept out of the web directory, and a configuration
file has been included. You will need to make sure that every .php script
in the HTML directory includes configuration.inc.  If you control your own
webserver, you can add a <Directory> command to your httpd.conf.

PHP:
PHP must be compiled with support for:
	PDO
	Mongo
	LDAP

	Actually, you can substitute any database support for MySQL, as our
framework uses PDO for database interaction.  However, the initial SQL
schema provided is specific to MySQL.  The schema would need to be modified
for other databases.

Mongo:
	The mongo driver usually needs to be installed, as it's a relatively new
extension for PHP.  Information on installing the Mongo extension is at
http://us.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php

LDAP:
	LDAP is only used for doing LDAP authentication for users.
If you're not going to do any LDAP authentication, you can delete or
comment out the LDAP stuff.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	We rely on Apache's mod_rewrite to route all traffic to /public/index.php
If this is the only web application on your apache server, you can just point
your apache's web directory to the public directory inside the application and
add the Rewrite rules.

	For us, we're running multiple applications, and have a seperate entry in
our Apache config for each one.  This does essentially the same thing.

Add to httpd.conf:

Alias /crm "/path/to/crm/public"
<Directory "/path/to/crm/public">
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /crm
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule .? /crm/index.php [NC,L]
</Directory>


	If you're running in a shared hosting environment, you cannot do Alias or
Directory commands.  However the public directory can be moved into your web
directory. To make sure the configuration file gets loaded, create an htaccess
file in this application's html directory with the php_value line from above.

Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	Edit configuration.inc with appropriate values for your installation.
