These tests make sure the models match up with the actual database.

These tests will be performing reads and writes, and will be
modifying whatever database you point to.
DO NOT point this at a production database.  You should edit the configuration
for these tests to point to a testing database.

You can prepare initial test data using mysqldump
mysqldump --xml -t dbname tablename > tablename.xml
