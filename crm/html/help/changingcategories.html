<p>Issues can now how custom fields associated with them based on its category. When adding a new case or issue, you must first choose a category so that uReport knows what fields to ask for.</p>

<p>Once the new case/issue has been added, the custom fields will show up in the issue area.</p>

<p><em>You cannot have two categories associated with the same case</em></p>

<p>To see an example of a category with custom cases, try adding a case with the category "graffiti"</p>

<h2>Changing the Category</h2>
<p>Changing the category of a case that has custom fields will result in new custom fields appearing in the issue area.</p>

<p>If the new category has the same custom field, the data will be preserved. If it doesn't the data will appear in the history of the issue.</p>
